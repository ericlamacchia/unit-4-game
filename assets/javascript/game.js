// Need to make a header containing a jumbotron with the title of my game, to be done on my html
// Will have an explanation of the rules below the jumbotron via the html
// Need to place the images for the jewels so they display on the page
// At the start of each game I need to have a random number that changes.
// Each of the jewels will be given a different value at the start of each new game, you will not know the value until you click the jewel
// In order to win this game you need to match your score to the random number so ill need to build a function
// Have a display for wins and losses that will update when you win or lose
